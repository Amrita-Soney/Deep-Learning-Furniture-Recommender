# Furniture Recommender System Integrating Deep Learning

## Introduction
I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of our ambitious research project, "Enhancing Interior Design: A Furniture Recommender System Integrating Deep Learning." Working alongside an exceptional team comprising Laksshay Sehrawat and Vanshika Gupta, we navigated through the intricacies of our project with dedication and precision.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of our project was to develop a furniture recommender system that enhances the interior design experience for customers. Traditional recommendation algorithms often rely on Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering techniques. However, our approach incorporates the latest advancements in deep learning by leveraging an image-based model (CNN). This novel methodology enables our system to understand compatibility from product imagery, mirroring the intuitive approach of professional interior designers and mitigating the cold start problem.

## Challenges and Exploration
Our exploration in the realm of Artificial Intelligence posed formidable challenges that demanded rigorous inquiry and innovative solutions. Through collaborative efforts, our team not only gained a profound understanding of the subject matter but also fostered a deeper appreciation for teamwork and shared passion.

## Team Recognition
I extend my sincere appreciation to my teammates Laksshay Sehrawat and Vanshika Gupta for their unwavering commitment and collaborative spirit throughout this project.
